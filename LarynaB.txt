I am Laryna Billinghurst

future is now

I like to create as a hobby. So that means building racing drones, programming, painting, etc. Favorite animal are cats, because they are always chill. Playing video games is the other hobby I spend time on. Helps with hand eye coordination and overall brain stimuli.
